Here I create an AWS cloud environment for the deployment environment.
And deploy the application backend infrastructure by using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI.
ALso deploy the application frontend: a react web application that,s hosted on an S3 bucket,
which acts as the web server, After application is up and running I put the application under 
source control by using AWS CodeCommit.
